In order to acquire fresh fish daily, the women are often pressured into having sex with the fishermen who supply the fish. It is not uncommon for the fishermen to maintain several such relationships simultaneously with women at different beaches where they land with their fish. As such, women fish traders are extremely susceptible to contracting HIV.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA couple of years ago, two Peace Corps Volunteers \u2013 Dominik Mucklow (an Education Volunteer, 2009-11) and Michael Geilhufe (a Community Economic Development Volunteer, 2010-12) \u2013 who lived near Lake Victoria decided to do something to help these women. With support from the \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.pepfar.gov\/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003EU.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)\u003C\/a\u003E, they assisted a group of women fish traders to acquire their own fishing boats. The women then employed men to go fishing using these boats. This simple advancement allowed the women to be free from sexual exploitation in order to secure their fish supply.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA third Volunteer, Samantha Slater (a Community Economic Development Volunteer, 2011-13) just completed her service. Samantha dedicated her work to helping the women with the business aspects of operating the boats and their fish trade. The women have since obtained additional loans to purchase new nets or replace damaged nets. They were also taught how to keep sound financial records and manage the business well enough to be able to pay back their loans in a timely way. Recently-arrived Volunteer Lori Armstrong will continue working on good business practices with the women. The work that these volunteers initiated has generated significant interest in development circles, and there is now a clear push to expand this \u201cNo Sex For Fish\u201d initiative to other beaches along Lake Victoria. With additional support, this simple initiative promises to completely re-write the gender relationships that rule Lake Victoria\u2019s fishing industry today.\u003C\/p\u003E"},{"blog_name":"peacecorps","id":54025466634,"post_url":"http:\/\/peacecorps.tumblr.com\/post\/54025466634\/find-an-hiv-testing-location-near-you","slug":"find-an-hiv-testing-location-near-you","type":"text","date":"2013-06-27 17:09:44 GMT","timestamp":1372352984,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"Bp6Je78c","tags":["prevention","testing","education","health","hiv","reblogs","global health"],"short_url":"http:\/\/tmblr.co\/ZtR4SxoKApCA","highlighted":[],"note_count":48,"title":"Find an HIV Testing Location Near You","body":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/blog.usa.gov\/post\/54024855363\/find-an-hiv-testing-location-near-you\u0022 class=\u0022tumblr_blog\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Eusagov\u003C\/a\u003E:\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday is National HIV Testing Day (NHTD).

you is one of the best parts of our jobs. That\u2019s why we\u2019re launching a Tumblr. We\u2019ll post things like the best quotes from President Obama, or video of young scientists visiting the White House for the science fair, or photos of adorable moments with Bo. We\u2019ve got some wonky charts, too. Because to us, those are actually kind of exciting.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut this is also about you. President Obama is committed to making this the most open and accessible administration in history, and our Tumblr is no exception.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe want to see what you have to share: Questions you have for the White House, stories of what a policy like immigration reform means to you, or ways we can improve our Tumbling. We\u2019re new here, and we\u2019re all ears.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo give us a follow, send a post our way using \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/whitehouse.tumblr.com\/submit\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Ethe submission tool\u003C\/a\u003E, and stick around to see some things you won\u2019t want to miss.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes, of course there will be GIFs.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022image\u0022 src=\u0022http:\/\/media.tumblr.com\/4b925dc346ef7b051d60f23d7161a9a1\/tumblr_inline_mlvflrwBYf1qz4rgp.jpg\u0022\/\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can also find us on\u00a0\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/whitehouse\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003EFacebook\u003C\/a\u003E,\u00a0\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/whitehouse\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003ETwitter\u003C\/a\u003E,\u00a0\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/whitehouse\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003EYouTube\u003C\/a\u003E, and\u00a0\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003EWhiteHouse.gov\u003C\/a\u003E.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003C\/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome, Welcome!\u003C\/p\u003E"},{"blog_name":"peacecorps","id":48935904972,"post_url":"http:\/\/peacecorps.tumblr.com\/post\/48935904972\/i","slug":"i","type":"text","date":"2013-04-26 16:30:14 GMT","timestamp":1366993814,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"lEEAZMY8","tags":["Peace Corps Volunteer","Malawi","Africa","geography","maps","education","school","youth","reblogs"],"short_url":"http:\/\/tmblr.co\/ZtR4SxjapgRC","highlighted":[],"note_count":25,"title":"I \u003C3 maps and you will too!","body":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca class=\u0022tumblr_blog\u0022 href=\u0022http:\/\/malawhee.tumblr.com\/post\/48777587606\/i\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Emalawhee\u003C\/a\u003E:\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI taught my Form One\u2019s their first geography lesson today. I\u2019m not sure if they learned geography in primary school, so maybe it was their first geography lesson ever.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo start, I had them draw a map of the world in their exercise books. The results were\u2026 interesting. Haha. I mean, they don\u2019t see images constantly like kids growing up in America do\u2026 they don\u2019t watch TV, they have limited textbooks, etc. So most of them didn\u2019t really know what it was supposed to look like. Some of them just drew a map of Malawi, which I thought was interesting.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, one popular Peace Corps activity undertaken by volunteers is the World Map Project. I am definitely going to try and do this at my school with my new geography students.

Some things, bride kidnapping for instance, are a bit different but the overall themes of domestic violence, sexual assault and discrimination are the same, if maybe just on a slightly different scale.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis was the topic of our most recent Mom\u2019s Club session and while encouraging in some respects, it has also left me feeling numb, confused and unfortunately, a little hopeless.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile it doesn\u2019t upset me as much as it used to, I am still taken aback, frustrated and angry every time I experience the gender inequality first hand here. I have been blatantly ignored by men, especially when I am with a male PCV, and I experience some form of verbal harassment at least every other week. Many people are confused when I tell them I am a business volunteer and not a teacher, calling me \u201cbusinessman\u201d which is humorous but annoying at the same time.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAll of this, however, if nothing compared to what locals experience here. I was quickly brought back to my days of working at DVSAS (Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Services) during our session. Our discussion of healthy relationships quickly took off into a debate over what to do in an abusive relationship. Should the woman leave? What would she do if she did? What would her family think? And worst of all: maybe she did something to deserve getting hit.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDomestic violence and sexual assault are topics that are hardly discussed in the United States. Here it is almost unheard of, sexual assault in particular. I have heard of some of the worst cases, which only makes me wonder how much is going on under the surface. The enormity of this situation all over the world feels like an unbearable weight I have no idea how to move.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe only thing I feel I can do at this point is encourage women to talk about it. This is not something to keep quiet, hidden within the household. It needs to be brought out and discussed, so that hopefully, someday things will begin to improve.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe one point of hope at the end of the session was the oldest woman in the group pointing out that \u201cWe only feel this way because of how we were raised. If we raise our children to think this is wrong and that they should expect more from their spouses, then things will begin to change.\u201d\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003C\/div\u003E\n\u003C\/div\u003E\n\u003C\/blockquote\u003E"}],"total_posts":34}}
