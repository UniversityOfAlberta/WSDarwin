(A\u00a0communications plan to complement the strategic plan would go far in aiding this mission, and I\u2019ve already expressed the value of having one. We\u2019ll see if this develops during the next two years.)<\/p>\n<p>So now that I got those buzzwords in (strategic framework, capacity building, behavior change), let me break it down for you. Fiji\u2019s Ministry of Health is doing what it can to reverse what is essentially a non-communicable disease (NCD) \u201ccrisis\u201d in this country of nearly 900,000. With one of the highest rates of diabetes in the world:<\/p>\n<ul><li><span>One in three Fijians has diabetes<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span>An amputation occurs every 12.6 hours in Fiji<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span>Only 16 percent of Fijians live past 55 years old<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul><p><span>Of course treating the NCDs is critical, but the ministry recognizes that educating the public about their behaviors will go along way in improving these deadly statistics.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>That\u2019s where we come in. We are working with the ministry to educate Fijians about what they can do to avoid NCDs: physical activity, healthy food choices, go to the doctor early instead of ignoring symptoms. We are working to build their capacity so that they have the kn<\/span><span>owledge to live healthy lives, and to teach their children about living healthy, long after we leave Fiji.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Will and I are in a unique situation with an open field of development opportunities because we\u2019re in a remote region that hasn\u2019t had Peace Corps volunteers since the 70s, and those were education volunteers. We\u2019re at the subdivisional level, which operates a hospital, a health center, a health inspector\u2019s office, a dentist\u2019s office, a maternal child health clinic, and multiple nursing stations throughout six islands. We have the opportunity to educate Fijians about:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul><li>NCD prevention<\/li>\n<li>Sexually transmitted infections (STIs)<\/li>\n<li>Sanitation and hygiene<\/li>\n<li>Women\u2019s empowerment<\/li>\n<li>Maternal-child health<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>So far we\u2019ve given health talks to villagers and trained health workers about practices for women\u2019s self-care and diabetes and hypertension prevention. Our subdivision is in the process of developing its business plan for the upcoming year, so things are a bit slow now. This gives us an opportunity to get to know our community and establish a relationship with the villagers, so they feel comfortable with us and trust us as we move forward together during these next two years.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>","tags":["peace corps fiji","fiji","international development","peace corps","reblogs","peace corps volunteers","global health"]},{"id":"78857793857","url":"http:\/\/peacecorps.tumblr.com\/post\/78857793857","url-with-slug":"http:\/\/peacecorps.tumblr.com\/post\/78857793857\/non-dominican-cooking-in-the-dr","type":"regular","date-gmt":"2014-03-07 17:01:08 GMT","date":"Fri, 07 Mar 2014 12:01:08","bookmarklet":0,"mobile":0,"feed-item":"","from-feed-id":0,"unix-timestamp":1394211668,"format":"html","reblog-key":"S9Bx1NB1","slug":"non-dominican-cooking-in-the-dr","regular-title":"Non-Dominican Cooking in the DR","regular-body":"<p><a class=\"tumblr_blog\" href=\"http:\/\/cruzandoelmar.tumblr.com\/post\/71259160057\/non-dominican-cooking-in-the-dr\" target=\"_blank\">cruzandoelmar<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https:\/\/31.media.tumblr.com\/3fa2d8b4bba19d032c299f30593cc8ca\/tumblr_inline_myfz50W2H71rg8ktl.jpg\"\/><\/p>\n<p>I\u2019d like to say that I am usually a more inventive cook, pero me da pena cocinar in my family\u2019s kitchen as I feel I\u2019m in the way half of the time, so I try to keep my meals under 20 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>Above you see peanut noodles.

She\u2019s a nice lady and makes her living usually by being a tailor. In the past few months, she\u2019s also started selling the local moonshine out of her house. For 100 CFA, men come by, take a shot of sodabe and then ride off on their motorcycles, rarely staying more than 5 minutes. One of my favorite nighttime activities is to sit on my front porch and watch how many of the men who stop by I recognize, either as colleagues or the father of one of my students.<\/p>\n<p>When I came back from vacation three days ago, a small hut with benches and tables had been erected outside her house, I guessed in an effort to expand her business, at least expand it out of her living room. And business has expanded, the area outside my front door becoming less like a front porch and more like the street outside a bar, but besides moto horns and loud voices, there haven\u2019t been any real complaints.<\/p>\n<p>And so, this morning, as I sipped my Harney &amp; Son\u2019s Tower of London tea, I silently toasted the men taking shots of sodabe next door at 8:30 in the morning.\u00a0<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>","tags":["Peace Corps volunteer","Benin","Africa","mornings","moonshine","peace corps","reblogs"]},{"id":"74184030478","url":"http:\/\/peacecorps.tumblr.com\/post\/74184030478","url-with-slug":"http:\/\/peacecorps.tumblr.com\/post\/74184030478\/what-its-like-here-cartagena-bolivar-colombia","type":"regular","date-gmt":"2014-01-22 17:30:16 GMT","date":"Wed, 22 Jan 2014 12:30:16","bookmarklet":0,"mobile":0,"feed-item":"","from-feed-id":0,"unix-timestamp":1390411816,"format":"html","reblog-key":"JN3xkJb1","slug":"what-its-like-here-cartagena-bolivar-colombia","regular-title":"What It\u2019s Like Here: Cartagena, Bolivar, Colombia","regular-body":"<p><a href=\"http:\/\/mfaunlv.tumblr.com\/post\/74097918162\/what-its-like-here-cartagena-bolivar-colombia\" class=\"tumblr_blog\" target=\"_blank\">mfaunlv<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote><p><em><strong>Regina Ernst<\/strong> is an UNLV MFA student in Fiction currently pursuing the Peace Corps track, <em><span id=\"internal-source-marker_0.3019247268010893\">fulfilling the international experience emphasis unique to the UNLV MFA program<\/span><\/em>.

I\u2019ve spent the last five months in cities on the North Atlantic coast, I\u2019ve moved permanently to Cartagena, and I\u2019ve realized I may never know what\u2019s going on here. But I do know some things.<\/p>\n<p>Last week, while visiting Barranquilla for official business, I dropped by my old host-mom\u2019s house to say hi. She\u2019s an energetic woman in her sixties who I\u2019d lived with for just over a month during my training. When she saw me through her open door, Sarita jumped from her seat at the dining room table and shuffled to receive me. She stood before me with her arms open absurdly wide. We hugged and kissed and she led me to the table. She didn\u2019t even ask if I wanted lunch before shoving a feast arroz con pollo with avocado in front of me, which I\u2019d learned never to say no to (and also, why would I?). I stayed to chat for a few hours and when I left, she escorted me to the door, lecturing me about how I was welcome at her house any time any day, the same sermon she gives me every time I visit her.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/31.media.tumblr.com\/edfbd4bd66492da6ef6430937bfd8f58\/tumblr_inline_mzrtf1X4QP1rf0pwk.jpg\" alt=\"image\"\/><\/p>\n<p><em>Las Murallas, the walls that surround the \u201cOld City\u201d with Bocagrande\u2019s modern cityscape in the distance. <\/em><\/p>\n\n<p><em><img src=\"https:\/\/31.media.tumblr.com\/4173654f0adc37d11fc6c50df9797e7a\/tumblr_inline_mzrthcbp9b1rf0pwk.jpg\" alt=\"image\"\/><\/em><\/p>\n\n<p><em>You\u2019re not a true Cartagenero\/a unless you\u2019re carrying around an authentic mochila.<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>The other day, when I boarded the bus after grocery shopping, my hands filled with tearing bags, I squeezed through a sea of men to stand among them, swaying with the harsh stop-and-go of the bus and gripping onto any bar or shoulder within reach for balance. Within minutes, a seat opened up. These bus rides are lengthy and hot, and these men were here long before I was. Yet, the man closest to the free seat (and therefore entitled to it) reached out to tap my shoulder, and I crowd-surfed to the back of the bus to claim his spot, my bags supported by the hands of strangers until I made it securely into the seat. An hour later, when we were approaching my location, I stood to yell for the driver to stop. He didn\u2019t hear me, so the chorus of men chanted on my behalf and the bus halted abruptly. All of them squished together to make room for me to exit. One took my hand to guide me down the steps.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/31.media.tumblr.com\/73aac8e5bbbf7d9f7669b676c57680da\/tumblr_inline_mzrtjehDH31rf0pwk.jpg\" alt=\"image\"\/><\/p>\n\n<p><em>One of the many plazas that make the Centro the beautiful but confusing labyrinth that it is, la Plaza de San Pedro Claver.<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p><em><img src=\"https:\/\/31.media.tumblr.com\/63e3eac2638546f48c4802777d9b10ce\/tumblr_inline_mzrtk8bHA91rf0pwk.jpg\" alt=\"image\"\/><\/em><\/p>\n\n<p><em>Servicio Nacional de Aprendizaje (SENA) in Casa de Marques in la Plaza de la Aduana.

It was my host-uncle, Roberto, a man in his fifties who lives with his sister, his niece, his father, and three other miscellaneous people (myself included). We\u2019ve lived in the same large house together for almost three months. We\u2019ve conversed every day. We\u2019ve worked around each other in the kitchen-space. Yet, when I caught up to him on the street that evening and greeted him, he turned to me surprised. His eyes opened large and he smiled so genuinely. Acting as if he hadn\u2019t seen me in years, he put out his hand to take mine and we kissed cheeks in typical Colombian fashion. Then we shared the rest of the walk home, chatting about our days. My young Spanish only permits me to comment on the basics\u2014where I was, what I was doing, who I was with, my plans for the evening\u2014but every response from him was full of interest and sincere curiosity.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/31.media.tumblr.com\/0477f5af674bd02e9ca022572ac518e1\/tumblr_inline_mzrtlklvvq1rf0pwk.jpg\" alt=\"image\"\/><\/p>\n\n<p><em>My host-sister, Lilia, and I standing on the shores of Playa Blanca on a nearby Caribbean island.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>So, this is what it\u2019s like here.

There\u2019ll be no flush toilets or showers. I can handle that. I might have to squash a few spiders, but for the high calling of changing the world, I think I can put up with those things.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But the truth is, hardship isn\u2019t the quirky and fun hardship you\u2019re expecting, where each new day brings adventure upon crazy adventure, more wonderful than the next. True hardship is much more sobering.<\/p>\n<p>During your service you might have to bury a neighbor. Or watch helplessly as your host family is torn to pieces by corruption. You might show up to school to learn one of your students was killed by a classmate. Your host sister could be kidnapped and forced to marry a man she\u2019s never met. You might witness abuse, violence and mistreatment. You may see your best student lose to a kid from another school because his bribe was the biggest. Your dog might be fed a needle, just to quiet it down, forever.<\/p>\n<p>And if none of that happens, then something else will. There\u2019s just no knowing how hard it will be or it what way. It could be dealing with other volunteers is your biggest challenge. Or that you can never live up to the expectations of your host organization. Or that the Internet is so accessible you spend your entire day trolling Facebook, jealous of all the lives continuing on back home.<\/p>\n<p>And what about all the things you\u2019ll give up? Your boyfriend might not wait two years for you. You\u2019ll put your career on hold. Your familiar support networks probably won\u2019t be around \u2013 there\u2019ll be no gym, no fast food joint, no car to drive, no family to visit. The stress and diet could make you lose thirty pounds\u2014or gain thirty\u2014whichever you don\u2019t want.<\/p>\n<p>The Peace Corps uses phrases like, \u201cLife is calling. How far will you go?\u201d and in a breath you\u2019re ready to sign your name on the line. But two years is a long, long time and in the middle you find the world you wanted to change is a confusing and complex puzzle of which you are just one, tiny piece.<\/p>\n<p>So please, if you\u2019re not ready for the heartbreak in the hardship, don\u2019t join the Peace Corps.<\/p>\n<p>Or do.<\/p>\n<p>Because you might just find that all your blood, sweat and tears are worth it \u2013 worth the pain, worth the time and worth the investment in the people for whom your heart breaks. Because you might learn some of the most important lessons of your life \u2013 that a broken heart can heal stronger than it was before, that a softened heart has more compassion for the world, and that in between its cracks and fissures is the only place where true beauty and grace can grow.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https:\/\/31.media.tumblr.com\/0086290a7bb3b555a7a1b700a102b2ec\/tumblr_inline_mz769kUxZl1rm0zr3.jpg\"\/><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><a class=\"post_tag\" href=\"http:\/\/tumblr.com\/tagged\/kyrgyzstan\" target=\"_blank\">#kyrgyzstan<\/a>\u00a0<a class=\"post_tag\" href=\"http:\/\/tumblr.com\/tagged\/heartbreak\" target=\"_blank\">#heartbreak<\/a>\u00a0<a class=\"post_tag\" href=\"http:\/\/tumblr.com\/tagged\/hardship\" target=\"_blank\">#hardship<\/a><\/p>","tags":["kyrgyzstan","peace corps","reblogs","peace corps volunteers","truth"]},{"id":"61677662909","url":"http:\/\/peacecorps.tumblr.com\/post\/61677662909","url-with-slug":"http:\/\/peacecorps.tumblr.com\/post\/61677662909\/nosexforfishkenya","type":"regular","date-gmt":"2013-09-19 16:14:26 GMT","date":"Thu, 19 Sep 2013 12:14:26","bookmarklet":0,"mobile":0,"feed-item":"","from-feed-id":0,"unix-timestamp":1379607266,"format":"html","reblog-key":"lMODXloh","slug":"nosexforfishkenya","regular-title":"No Sex for Fish - Redefining Gender Relationships in Lake Victoria, Kenya ","regular-body":"<p>Women living along the shores of Lake Victoria whose livelihood depends on trading fresh fish are exceptionally vulnerable to contracting HIV. In order to acquire fresh fish daily, the women are often pressured into having sex with the fishermen who supply the fish. It is not uncommon for the fishermen to maintain several such relationships simultaneously with women at different beaches where they land with their fish. As such, women fish traders are extremely susceptible to contracting HIV.<\/p>\n<p>A couple of years ago, two Peace Corps Volunteers \u2013 Dominik Mucklow (an Education Volunteer, 2009-11) and Michael Geilhufe (a Community Economic Development Volunteer, 2010-12) \u2013 who lived near Lake Victoria decided to do something to help these women. With support from the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pepfar.gov\/\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)<\/a>, they assisted a group of women fish traders to acquire their own fishing boats. The women then employed men to go fishing using these boats. This simple advancement allowed the women to be free from sexual exploitation in order to secure their fish supply.<\/p>\n<p>A third Volunteer, Samantha Slater (a Community Economic Development Volunteer, 2011-13) just completed her service. Samantha dedicated her work to helping the women with the business aspects of operating the boats and their fish trade. The women have since obtained additional loans to purchase new nets or replace damaged nets. They were also taught how to keep sound financial records and manage the business well enough to be able to pay back their loans in a timely way. Recently-arrived Volunteer Lori Armstrong will continue working on good business practices with the women. The work that these volunteers initiated has generated significant interest in development circles, and there is now a clear push to expand this \u201cNo Sex For Fish\u201d initiative to other beaches along Lake Victoria. With additional support, this simple initiative promises to completely re-write the gender relationships that rule Lake Victoria\u2019s fishing industry today.<\/p>","tags":["AIDS","gender","sexual exploitation","PEPFAR","Africa","Kenya","Lake Victoria","community development","economic development","fishing","global health","small business development","women"]},{"id":"54025466634","url":"http:\/\/peacecorps.tumblr.com\/post\/54025466634","url-with-slug":"http:\/\/peacecorps.tumblr.com\/post\/54025466634\/find-an-hiv-testing-location-near-you","type":"regular","date-gmt":"2013-06-27 17:09:44 GMT","date":"Thu, 27 Jun 2013 13:09:44","bookmarklet":0,"mobile":0,"feed-item":"","from-feed-id":0,"unix-timestamp":1372352984,"format":"html","reblog-key":"Bp6Je78c","slug":"find-an-hiv-testing-location-near-you","regular-title":"Find an HIV Testing Location Near You","regular-body":"<p><a href=\"http:\/\/blog.usa.gov\/post\/54024855363\/find-an-hiv-testing-location-near-you\" class=\"tumblr_blog\" target=\"_blank\">usagov<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Today is National HIV Testing Day (NHTD).

That\u2019s why we\u2019re launching a Tumblr. We\u2019ll post things like the best quotes from President Obama, or video of young scientists visiting the White House for the science fair, or photos of adorable moments with Bo. We\u2019ve got some wonky charts, too. Because to us, those are actually kind of exciting.<\/p>\n<p>But this is also about you. President Obama is committed to making this the most open and accessible administration in history, and our Tumblr is no exception.<\/p>\n<p>We want to see what you have to share: Questions you have for the White House, stories of what a policy like immigration reform means to you, or ways we can improve our Tumbling. We\u2019re new here, and we\u2019re all ears.<\/p>\n<p>So give us a follow, send a post our way using <a href=\"http:\/\/whitehouse.tumblr.com\/submit\" target=\"_blank\">the submission tool<\/a>, and stick around to see some things you won\u2019t want to miss.<\/p>\n<p>And yes, of course there will be GIFs.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/media.tumblr.com\/4b925dc346ef7b051d60f23d7161a9a1\/tumblr_inline_mlvflrwBYf1qz4rgp.jpg\"\/><\/p>\n<p>You can also find us on\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/whitehouse\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/whitehouse\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/whitehouse\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube<\/a>, and\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/\" target=\"_blank\">WhiteHouse.gov<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Welcome, Welcome!<\/p>","tags":["reblogs","The White House","government on tumblr"]},{"id":"48935904972","url":"http:\/\/peacecorps.tumblr.com\/post\/48935904972","url-with-slug":"http:\/\/peacecorps.tumblr.com\/post\/48935904972\/i","type":"regular","date-gmt":"2013-04-26 16:30:14 GMT","date":"Fri, 26 Apr 2013 12:30:14","bookmarklet":0,"mobile":0,"feed-item":"","from-feed-id":0,"unix-timestamp":1366993814,"format":"html","reblog-key":"lEEAZMY8","slug":"i","regular-title":"I <3 maps and you will too!","regular-body":"<p><a class=\"tumblr_blog\" href=\"http:\/\/malawhee.tumblr.com\/post\/48777587606\/i\" target=\"_blank\">malawhee<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n\n<p>I taught my Form One\u2019s their first geography lesson today. I\u2019m not sure if they learned geography in primary school, so maybe it was their first geography lesson ever.<\/p>\n<p>To start, I had them draw a map of the world in their exercise books. The results were\u2026 interesting. Haha. I mean, they don\u2019t see images constantly like kids growing up in America do\u2026 they don\u2019t watch TV, they have limited textbooks, etc. So most of them didn\u2019t really know what it was supposed to look like. Some of them just drew a map of Malawi, which I thought was interesting.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, one popular Peace Corps activity undertaken by volunteers is the World Map Project. I am definitely going to try and do this at my school with my new geography students. By the end of this term these kids will KNOW that America is not in Europe.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/media.tumblr.com\/85e7c12ca045befcf10af69adb9af616\/tumblr_inline_mlrmsj6ftt1qz4rgp.jpg\"\/><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>","tags":["Peace Corps Volunteer","Malawi","Africa","geography","maps","education","school","youth","reblogs"]},{"id":"44871995483","url":"http:\/\/peacecorps.tumblr.com\/post\/44871995483","url-with-slug":"http:\/\/peacecorps.tumblr.com\/post\/44871995483\/what-do-you-go-home-to","type":"regular","date-gmt":"2013-03-08 18:30:15 GMT","date":"Fri, 08 Mar 2013 13:30:15","bookmarklet":0,"mobile":0,"feed-item":"","from-feed-id":0,"unix-timestamp":1362767415,"format":"html","reblog-key":"KdFLOegB","slug":"what-do-you-go-home-to","regular-title":"what do you go home to?","regular-body":"<p><a class=\"tumblr_blog\" href=\"http:\/\/www.alymarczynski.com\/post\/44693592718\/what-do-you-go-home-to\" target=\"_blank\">alymarczynski<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>\u201cWomen here always feel they <em>must<\/em> do things; they <em>must<\/em> clean the house, they <em>must<\/em> cook, they <em>must<\/em> forgive their husbands.\u201d And so I dove straight into the world of women\u2019s rights, gender roles and healthy relationships here in Kyrgyzstan.<\/p>\n<p>One thing I want to make very clear is that the problems women face here are not unlike things we experience in the United States. Some things, bride kidnapping for instance, are a bit different but the overall themes of domestic violence, sexual assault and discrimination are the same, if maybe just on a slightly different scale.<\/p>\n<p>This was the topic of our most recent Mom\u2019s Club session and while encouraging in some respects, it has also left me feeling numb, confused and unfortunately, a little hopeless.<\/p>\n<p>While it doesn\u2019t upset me as much as it used to, I am still taken aback, frustrated and angry every time I experience the gender inequality first hand here. I have been blatantly ignored by men, especially when I am with a male PCV, and I experience some form of verbal harassment at least every other week. Many people are confused when I tell them I am a business volunteer and not a teacher, calling me \u201cbusinessman\u201d which is humorous but annoying at the same time.<\/p>\n<p>All of this, however, if nothing compared to what locals experience here. I was quickly brought back to my days of working at DVSAS (Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Services) during our session. Our discussion of healthy relationships quickly took off into a debate over what to do in an abusive relationship. Should the woman leave? What would she do if she did? What would her family think? And worst of all: maybe she did something to deserve getting hit.<\/p>\n<p>Domestic violence and sexual assault are topics that are hardly discussed in the United States. Here it is almost unheard of, sexual assault in particular. I have heard of some of the worst cases, which only makes me wonder how much is going on under the surface. The enormity of this situation all over the world feels like an unbearable weight I have no idea how to move.<\/p>\n<p>The only thing I feel I can do at this point is encourage women to talk about it. This is not something to keep quiet, hidden within the household. It needs to be brought out and discussed, so that hopefully, someday things will begin to improve.<\/p>\n<p>The one point of hope at the end of the session was the oldest woman in the group pointing out that \u201cWe only feel this way because of how we were raised. If we raise our children to think this is wrong and that they should expect more from their spouses, then things will begin to change.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/blockquote>","tags":["kyrgyzstan","reblogs","gender equality","sexism","women's rights","gender roles","gender issues","culture","domestic violence","International Women's Day"]}]};
